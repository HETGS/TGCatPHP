<h3> About TGCat </h3>
  The Chandra Grating-Data Archive and Catalog (<i><b>TG</b>Cat</i>) makes
  grating spectra easily viewable and accessible.  The browse-able
  interface to analysis-quality spectral products (binned spectra and
  corresponding response files), with the addition of summary
  graphical products and model-independent flux properties tables make
  it easy to find observations of a particular object, type of object,
  or type of observation, to quickly assess the quality and potential
  usefulness of the spectra, and to download the data and responses as
  a package.

<br><br>

  In addition to the data, portable reprocessing scripts, using CXC
  and other publicly available 
  <a href="http://space.mit.edu/cxc/analysis/tgcat/index.html"> software </a>
  (which were used to create
  the archive) are also available, facilitating standard or
  customized reprocessing from Level 1 archive data to spectra and
  responses with minimal interaction.

<br><br>

  In addition to standard products for single point-sources, we will
  add custom extractions of more complex sources, such as close or
  extended sources, and we will provide some aggregate products from
  multiple observations of the same object.

<h3> Credits </h3>
<p style="width:70%">

  <i><b>TG</b>Cat</i> development was directed by David Huenemoerder, who is also
  responsible for reprocessing scripts.  Arik Mitschang is responsible
  for design and implementation of the database and web interface.
  For ongoing support, review, and testing we thank John Davis, Dan
  Dewey, John Houck, Herman Marshall, Doug Morgan, Joy Nichols, Mike
  Noble, Mike Nowak, and Norbert Schulz.

<br><br>

  If you use <i><b>TG</b>Cat</i> in your research, we would appreciate an
  acknowledgment (until we have a literature citation), such as:
<br>
    <i>"This research made use of the Chandra Transmission Grating
    Catalog and archive (http://tgcat.mit.edu)."</i>
